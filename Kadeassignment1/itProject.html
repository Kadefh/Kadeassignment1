<p>My idea for an IT project is to design a mobile application that aims to reduce the wastage of perishable foods such as meats, fruit, vegetables, and dairy, in the form of a recipe app. The idea is that people can have a look at what’s in their fridge, see what foods are about to expire, open the app, enter the items they intend to use, and a recipe will be available for them to use. This app could save households hundreds of dollars on their groceries each year by dramatically reducing the amount of food households throw away.</p>
<p>Cooking is one of my favourite hobbies. I enjoy experimenting and creating new recipes for my friends and family, which is why I’m excited to do a project such as this. Earlier this year I started purchasing my food through Hello Fresh. One thing I admire about Hello Fresh is that they deliver the right quantity of the ingredients you’re using so that there is zero wastage. Hello Fresh also has an app where you can order your meals for the week and look at other different recipes they have in their system. Unfortunately, their recipes are catered to their customers only; they don’t list the quantities of each ingredient required for the recipe.</p>
<p>My plans for this app would be a large database of perishable ingredients that users will be able to select, which will then be paired to a recipe. These recipes will be put into categorised databases that would help the user pinpoint what they want; such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, vegetarian, vegan, ketogenic, etc. This would simplify the way a user searches for a particular recipe.
Once the user has selected the meal they wish to create, the recipe would have a description of the meal they’re making, a serving size calculator to help them with the quantity of ingredients they need, the ingredients required and the method to cook the recipe.
Some important future features that I would love to have that would set my app apart from the rest of the competition; would be the option for users to create an account with the app so that they may review the recipes and share recipes via social media or text. It would also have detailed, high-quality photos and videos to go with each recipe so that the user has a clear visual on what they’re meant to be doing and how it’s meant to look. I would like to have a ‘Featured recipes’ section for the app, for recipes that are popular among users or recipes that have been received really well in reviews to help users find great tasting recipes. Lastly, I would like to have my app available to as many users as possible, so having the app on iOS, Android and iPad would be key. 
After doing some research, I found that there have been apps created that are like my idea. However, I feel like there is plenty of room for improvement. For instance, some apps only allow you to select one ingredient to search for rather than a collection of ingredients, some don’t have all the features I listed earlier, such as a serving size calculator or the ability to share recipes with others, and some apps just aren’t very aesthetically pleasing to use. Therefore, I believe my app would be set apart from the others. This app is a fantastic opportunity for people to cut their grocery expenses by utilising every ingredient they purchase, rather than letting it go to waste.
Obviously, this task would be no easy feat. It would require several hundred hours entering ingredients into a database, categorising each of those ingredients into a recipe that will then be categorised into different meal types. There’s also the issue of creating hundreds of different recipes to make sure the users have plenty of meals to choose from. This would need to be handled over time by consistently adding recipes to the app to keep users coming back. Additionally, the features of the app would be a difficult task for someone like me, who has not had any experience with designing an app before, so this would require an understanding of Java and/or Python. It would also be worthwhile learning Swift to have the app on iOS and iPadOS, as well as Android.
</p>
<p>The software I would need to create my app would be some software development tools such as Xcode for iOS and Android studio for Android, version control software such as Github to assist in group work when developing the app and updates, photo and video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop to create professional photos and videos of the recipes and possibly cloud storage for all the content being put onto the app. The hardware I would require would be a computer to design the app, an iPhone and Android phone to test the app, possibly a NAS (Network-attached storage) if that was a more viable option opposed to purchasing cloud storage online, and a camera to shoot the photos and videos for the recipes.</p>
<p>If the project was successful, it would have the opportunity to significantly cut food wastage in households, this would assist in cutting peoples grocery expenses by having a platform to find recipes for ingredients in their fridge that are close to their expiry date. It also has the potential to assist farmers with demands during tough times with draughts, with over $20 billion worth of food being wasted each year in Australia, it would certainly help farmers to have that number significantly reduced (Afshariyan, 2018).</p>
