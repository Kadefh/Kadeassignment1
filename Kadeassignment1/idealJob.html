<p>An ideal job that I found on seek that I found interesting was a software engineering position for Metro Trains, Melbourne.</p>
<p>This job would involve the installation of software to assist tram passengers and staff; helping passengers be connected online while also helping staff with installing software that eliminates the need for paper. This will be carried out using various programming, using Javascript and Java to install the software and to carry it out onto all current platforms. After installation is complete, the software engineer would also need to carry out regular maintenance and troubleshoot intricate problems with the software.</p>
<p>I find this job interesting because it would be a great opportunity to work on some sizable long-term projects in a team environment. I also find this job appealing because of the amount of people that would benefit from your hard work every day. </p>
<p>The successful applicant would need to possess a suitable knowledge base using various operating systems when carrying out and troubleshooting the software installation (Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android). They would also be expected to have good communication skills as they would be working in a team environment, as well as be accommodating to a fast-paced work environment. The applicant is also expected to have had previous experience in a study or work environment of over 5 years in a software engineering role and experience with Java, Javascript and SQL.</p>
<p>Some skills that I think I possess that would be relevant to the role would be; being able to communicate well in a team environment, I have a good knowledge base around the use of Windows, Mac, iOS and Android and have recently started to learn Javascript.</p>
<p>To achieve this role, I would first concentrate on completing my course at RMIT (Bachelor of Information Technology). Whilst completing my course I would also focus on learning programming languages specific to the role, such as SQL. Additionally, I could also seek out employment or work experience in a software development environment to further increase my knowledge base.</p>
