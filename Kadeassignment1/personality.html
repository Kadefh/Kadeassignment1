<p>I found the results of my 3 personality tests (Myers-Briggs, Big 5 Personality test and my online learning style test) to be both surprising in some areas, and fitting in others. I have always thought that I was more of an introvert, but looking further into the answers of the test, I could be have been wrong</p>
<p>I think that my results would benefit a team to be geared towards organisation. I enjoy being ahead of time to leave space for when things go wrong so that I can be prepared for those situations. I think this can also leave room for improvement for me when it comes to adaptability. I enjoy adapting to new changes under good organisation. However, sometimes changes can come quickly, it would be beneficial to me to be able to adapt without notice a little easier.</p>
<p>When forming a team I think I would certainly preference like minded people who are organised and value succeeding as much as I try to. I would also keep in mind when forming a team that some people also prefer to complete tasks as they learn them and spread their time out over the complete timeframe. </p>
